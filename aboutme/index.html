    <h2>Khulani Clive Ncube</h2>
    <h2>aka Big Man</h2>
    <p>I am persuing a degree in Applied Technology with BYU-Idaho and I want to be involved in regulating Artificial Inteligence in the future.I am 27 years old from South Africa and I am single with no kids but i believ the right one will come when the time is right.</p> 
    <p>I am a massive Liverpool fan but I have been trying to stop because it gets in the way of the important things in life. Besides soccer I love learning and discovering new things. 
        My ideal life would be to work for an international organisation traveling the world however in the meantime I believe this course will help me make a living by creating websites for people starting businesses in my area and the surrounding areas and I can also get employment while I study.</p>
    <p>I served my mission in the South Africa Durban Mission and there I fell deeply in love with the gospel of Jesus Christ as I saw the change that it brought to peoples lives. It has brought so much change in my life, from being a very shy young man to someone who loves public speaking, to being able to find my purpose in life and developing a strong personal relationship with the Lord.</p>
    <p>I am excited to take up this class and getting to know all of you my brothers and sisters. As the scriptures teach "it is by small and simple things that great things are brought to pass".</p>
